This is a template for PostHog plugins. The existing sample code adds property `"greeting"` to every event with a configurable value (by default: `"Hello world!"`).

To make this template your own:
- [ ] Add your code to `index.js`
- [ ] Add your configuration and metadata to `plugin.json`
- [ ] Optional: Add a `logo.png` file to give this plugin its own logo.
- [ ] Search for `<TODO:`, make sure none exist

If you're looking for inspiration, here are a few exemplary plugins:
